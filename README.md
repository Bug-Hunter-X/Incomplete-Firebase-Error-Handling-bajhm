# Firebase Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase error handling and provides a solution for improved robustness.

## The Problem
Often, developers only handle a subset of potential Firebase errors, leading to unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior in their applications.  This example focuses on authentication errors, but the principle applies to other Firebase services.

## The Solution
The improved example provides comprehensive error handling for several common authentication errors, and includes a general catch-all for unexpected errors. This approach makes the application more resilient to unforeseen issues.
